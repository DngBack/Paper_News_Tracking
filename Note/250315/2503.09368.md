# PerCoV2: A New Ultra-Low Bit-Rate Perceptual Image Compression System

## Overview
PerCoV2 is an innovative perceptual image compression system that operates at ultra-low bit rates. Developed by researchers from the Technical University of Munich and the University of Applied Sciences Landshut, this system builds upon the foundational work of Careil et al. and integrates seamlessly with the Stable Diffusion 3 architecture. Its primary goal is to enhance entropy coding efficiency through explicit modeling of the hyper-latent image distribution, making it particularly suitable for applications with limited bandwidth and storage.

## Contributions
The article presents several key contributions:
- **Hybrid Generation Mode**: PerCoV2 introduces a hybrid generation mode that allows for additional bit-rate savings.
- **Accessibility**: The system utilizes public components, ensuring that it is accessible for further research and development.
- **Generative Models**: It employs generative models, specifically diffusion models, to synthesize realistic image details, thereby improving perceptual quality.

## Results
A comprehensive evaluation conducted on the MSCOCO-30k benchmark reveals that PerCoV2 significantly outperforms previous models, particularly at ultra-low bit rates ranging from 0.003 to 0.03 bits per pixel (bpp). Despite its impressive performance in maintaining competitive perceptual quality at these low bit rates, the system shows reduced effectiveness at higher bit rates, indicating an area for potential future enhancement.

## Methods
The architecture of PerCoV2 consists of:
- **Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)**: An encoder and decoder that facilitate the compression process.
- **Feature Extractors**: Components that enhance the quality of the generated images.
- **Discrete Entropy Model**: A model that aids in efficient data representation.

The training process optimizes the model using a conditional flow matching objective while exploring various autoregressive entropy modeling techniques. The results underscore PerCoV2's capability to achieve high-quality image compression while preserving essential semantic information, marking a significant advancement in the field of image compression.

## Availability
The code and trained models for PerCoV2 will be made publicly available on GitHub, encouraging further exploration and application within the domain.
