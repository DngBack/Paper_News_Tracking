# EgoLife: Developing an AI-Powered Egocentric Life Assistant

## Overview
The EgoLife project focuses on creating an egocentric life assistant through the use of AI-powered wearable glasses. This innovative approach aims to enhance daily living by providing personalized support based on individual activities and habits.

## Contributions
The project has produced the EgoLife Dataset, which consists of 300 hours of multimodal egocentric video data collected from six participants who lived together for a week. This dataset serves as the foundation for EgoLifeQA, a benchmark designed for long-context question-answering tasks. EgoLifeQA assists users in recalling past events and monitoring their daily habits.

## Results and Methods
To tackle significant technical challenges, such as developing robust visual-audio models, identity recognition, and long-context question answering, the project employs the EgoButler system. This system integrates two key components: EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is a multimodal model specifically trained on egocentric datasets, while EgoRAG enhances memory and query capabilities, providing personalized assistance to users.

The EgoLife Dataset and its associated benchmarks address existing gaps in egocentric datasets, paving the way for research into long-term behavior patterns and social interactions. Future plans include expanding the dataset to encompass a wider range of languages and activities, with the ultimate goal of creating AI that seamlessly integrates into and supports human experiences.

The project also places a strong emphasis on ethical considerations, participant privacy, and the potential social impact of AI assistants in improving daily life.
